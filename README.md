## Introduction

The Iris flower dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   

   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

   
   jupyter notebook Iris_Flower_Classification.ipynb
   ```

2. Follow the steps in the notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Iris flower dataset, which is commonly used for classification tasks in machine learning.

## Model

The project uses a [choose the type of model, e.g., Random Forest Classifier] to classify the Iris flowers.

## Results

[Include information about the model's performance, such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
